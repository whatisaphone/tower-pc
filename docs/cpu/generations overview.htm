include 16-bit arithmetic, signed 8- and 16-bit arithmetic
(including multiply and divide), efficient interruptible

<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial">Introduction</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">In 1979, Intel introduced the 8086
and 8088 microprocessor extensions to the 8080 product line.
Since that time, the x86 product line has gone through six
generations and become the most successful microprocessor in
history. Much of this success was due to the success of the
IBM-PC and its clones. Therefore Intel was at the right place at
the right time when IBM made their historic decision to use the
8088. Today, the x86 market is a multi-billion dollar industry,
selling tens-of-millions of units per year.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The huge popularity of these x86
chips has lead to a prosperous x86 clone industry. AMD, Cyrix,
IBM, TI, UMC, Siemens, NEC, Harris, and others have all dabbled
in the x86 chip industry. Today, AMD, Cyrix, and Centaur are
still actively competing. However, there are numerous stories
that approximately one dozen other companies are actively working
to create a x86 clone chip. Ultimately, the market will decide
who survives and who perishes in this cutthroat chips business.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Merced</strong></font></h3>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">Merced is Intel's
future-generation microprocessor architecture; Merced is not
Intel's next-generation x86 microprocessor. Instead, Merced is a
completely new microprocessor design and instruction set. Merced
will have the means to run legacy x86 programs via a hardware
translation mechanism.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">The Merced design
is a further departure from its x86 predecessors. Merced is not </font><a

color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial"> design (Very Long

ostensibly for political reasons (not invented here). Instead,
Intel has coined the term </font><a href="help.htm#EPIC"><font

color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial"> -- Explicitely Parallel
Instruction Computing. For all intents and purposes, EPIC is
VLIW.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">First versions of
Merced will run between 600 MHz and 1000 MHz (1 GHz). x86
compatibility is acheived internally via a hardware translation
mechanism. This translation mechanism enables Merced to run your
existing Windows and DOS applications. Intel claims that Merced
will never run x86 programs as fast as the current
state-of-the-art x86 microprocessors. Therefore, Intel offers
Merced into the server and workstation market, and will offer x86
compatibility as a matter of convenience.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Xeon</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">The Xeon is a
Pentium II on steroids. The Pentium II contains a P6 (Pentium
Pro) core with a 1/2-speed 2nd-level cache (L2 cache). Xeon
differs from Pentium II in that the L2 cache runs at full
processor speed. Pentium II connects to the motherboard in a slot
named Slot-1. Xeon is not slot-compatible with Pentium II.
Instead, Xeon uses a new slot named Slot-2.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">Xeon is Intel's
high-end microprocessor brand for the computer server market. As
such, Xeon is priced much higher than Pentium II or Celeron.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Celeron</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">The Celeron
microprocessor is a stripped down Pentium II. This chip is
affectionately knows as &quot;the Castrated One.&quot; The
Celeron is offered without any 2nd-level cache, making its
performance lackluster, and reportedly slower than a Pentium
(with </font><a href="help.htm#MMX"><font color="#000000"
size="3" face="Arial">MMX</font></a><font color="#000000"
size="3" face="Arial">) running at nearly one-half of its speed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">Intel was
completely caught off-guard by the advent and popularity of the
sub-$1000 PC. In fact, the sub-$1000 PC completely ruins Intel's
marketing game plan. Therefore, Intel hastily created the Celeron
in an attempt to regain some marketshare they lost to their
competition.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Pentium II</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">The Pentium II is
a glorified Pentium Pro with </font><a href="help.htm#MMX"><font
color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">MMX</font></a><font
color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial"> extensions. The Pentium II
has a different package than the Pentium Pro. This new package is
called &quot;Slot-1.&quot; Officially, Intel claimed technical
reasons for needing Slot-1. Industry pundits claimed that slot-1
was devised to thwart industry competition with the Pentium Pro,
and further the Intel monopoly. Strangely, the &quot;technical
reasons for needing slot-1&quot; evaporated as soon as the
Pentium Pro was dead; as Intel somehow made a
&quot;breakthrough&quot; that they had previously claimed was
impossible (thereby &quot;needing&quot; to invent the proprietary
slot-1).</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">Slot-1 was also
promised to be the upgrade path for consumers -- leading many
years into the future. Unfortunately, every time Intel has made
this promise, first with the 80486, then with the Pentium, the
promise has been broken. As soon as Intel saturated the saturated
the market with slot-1 computers, they announced the future high
performance upgrade path would be &quot;slot-2.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">The Pentium II can
address up to 64 GB of main memory, but has </font><a
href="help.htm#Cache"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">cache</font></a><font
color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial"> limitations preventing
memory use above 512 MB.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial">The Pentium Pro</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The Pentium Pro was introduced in
November 1995 as Intel's 6<sup>th</sup> generation x86 design --
code-named the &quot;P6.&quot; The Pentium Pro offered some minor
programming enhancements, four more address lines, and a large 2<sup>nd</sup>-level
</font><a href="help.htm#Cache"><font size="3" face="Arial">cache</font></a><font
size="3" face="Arial">. By this time, the entire &quot;<b><i>secret</i></b>&quot;
programming features of the Pentium had been revealed (mostly at
the Intel Secrets Web Site: </font><a href="http://www.x86.org/"><font
size="3" face="Arial">http://www.x86.org</font></a><font size="3"
face="Arial">). Therefore, Intel abandoned their attempts at
keeping most of their new P6 programming features as a secret. By
adding four more </font><a href="help.htm#Address Lines"><font
size="3" face="Arial">address lines</font></a><font size="3"
face="Arial">, the Pentium Pro could address up to 64 GB of main
memory. The addition of the 2<sup>nd</sup>-level cache gave the
Pentium Pro a nice performance boost, but was very expensive to
manufacture.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Intel continued their attempts at
closing the architecture to the exclusion and elimination of
their competition. Intel managed to gain patent protection for
some pins on the Pentium Pro socket; thus making this chip very
difficult to clone without substantial legal liability. However,
Intel wasn't paranoid enough. Intel introduced the Pentium II
under the guise that the Pentium Pro could never achieve their
performance goals. Intel alleged that the Pentium Pro 2<sup>nd</sup>-level
cache could never run faster than 200 MHz, and therefore they
must discontinue the development of this product line. The
Pentium II abandoned the socket approach to microprocessors, and
introduced the &quot;slot&quot; concept. The slot-1 of the
Pentium II was further enshrouded in patent protection, thereby
further raising the bar to the cost of competition. Now that the
Pentium Pro is dead (along with the possibility that their
competition will clone this product), Intel has ironically
announced a 400 MHz Pentium II with a full-speed 2<sup>nd</sup>-level
cache.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Regardless of Intel's continued
monopolistic business practices, the P6 product line has
diversified and flourished. The Pentium II added </font><a
href="help.htm#MMX"><font size="3" face="Arial">MMX</font></a><font
size="3" face="Arial"> enhancements and a variety of 2<sup>nd</sup>-level
cache options. Intel has created the Celeron brand to compete in
the sub-$1000 market. The Xeon was introduced to compete in the
server market with a 100 MHz system bus. As time goes on, Intel
will continue to diversify the P6 family product line, most
likely with a 200 MHz system bus.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Intel's competitors have gone in a
different direction than Intel. Intel's competitors have stayed
with a Pentium-compatible pin-out. AMD has continued to develop
the K6 processor and added MMX enhancements. Cyrix has added MMX
enhancements to the MII product line. Centaur products always
contained MMX enhancements. These three companies combined their
abilities to create a common set MMX-3D instruction set
extensions. All three companies have announced plans to create a
100 MHz system bus and an integrated 2<sup>nd</sup>-level cache
(though Intel-fellow Fred Pollack has said publicly that the 2<sup>nd</sup>-level
cache integration is electronically impossible).</font></p>

<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial">The Pentium</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The Pentium processor was a big
departure from all past Intel x86 processors. The Pentium name
signaled the end to the 80x86 nomenclature, and was spurred by
losing a trademark dispute against AMD. The Pentium processor
contained more than one execution unit -- making it superscalar.
Intel no longer needed (or wanted) any second-source fabs
manufacturing their microprocessors; Intel wanted all of the
profits to themselves. The Pentium also added many programming
enhancements though Intel tried to keep all of them secret.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Intel rapidly diversified the
Pentium product line. The original Pentium product ran at 60 and
66 MHz. Shortly thereafter, Intel introduced 90, 100, 120, 133
MHz versions of the popular processor. Intel introduced low-power
versions of the Pentium to be used in notebook computer
applications. Finally, Intel introduced the </font><a
href="help.htm#MMX"><font size="3" face="Arial">MMX</font></a><font
size="3" face="Arial">-enhanced processors.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">AMD and Cyrix didn't sit idly by
and watch Intel expand and dominate the market. AMD introduced
the K5 processor -- their first in-house x86 design. However, the
K5 was late to market, and was very slow. In response to their
bleak outlook for the K5, AMD bought Nexgen. Nexgen created their
own x86-compatible microprocessor, calling it the Nx586. At the
time of the acquisition, Nexgen had already finished the design
of their next-generation processor core -- the Nx686. AMD used
the Nx686 core and created the successful K6 processor. AMD has
continued to upgrade this processor to include MMX, and other
enhancements.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">During this time Cyrix introduced
the 6x86. The 6x86 was pin-compatible with the Pentium, though
the 6x86 nomenclature might lead the consumer to believe that it
is a 6<sup>th</sup>-generation (Pentium Pro) compatible chip. The
6x86 has also been enhanced with MMX instructions as the 6x86 MX.
Cyrix has continued to enhance this chip in their attempt to gain
more market share.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">During the Pentium era, a new
Intel competitor emerged. Centaur Technologies (a wholly owned
subsidiary of IDT) created a fast, cheap, and somewhat low power
Pentium compatible chip. Centaur has a low-end (low-cost) market
focus. Some industry pundits have called this marketing strategy
&quot;bottom-feeding.&quot; However, with the emergence and
overwhelming popularity of the sub-$1000 PC, Centaur may end up
having the last laugh.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial">The 80486</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 80486 offered little in the
way of architectural enhancements over its 80386 predecessor. The
most significant enhancement of the 486 family was the
integration of the 80387-math coprocessor into the 80486-core
logic. Now, all software that requires the math coprocessor could
run on the 80486 without any expensive hardware upgrades.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Like the 80386 SX, Intel decided
to introduce the 80486 SX as a cost-reduced 80486 DX.
Unfortunately, Intel chose to ensure that these processors were
neither pin-compatible, nor 100% software compatible with each
other. Unlike the 80386 SX, the 80486 SX enjoyed the full data
bus and address bus of its DX counterpart. Instead, Intel removed
the math coprocessor, thereby rendering the 80486 SX somewhat
software incompatible with its DX counterpart. To further
complicate matters, Intel introduced the 80487 SX -- the &quot;<b><i>math
coprocessor</i></b>&quot; to the 80486 SX. Intel convinced
vendors to include a new socket on the motherboard that could
accommodate the 80486 SX and 80487 SX as an expensive hardware
upgrade option. Unbeknownst to the consumer, the 80486 SX was an
80486 DX with a non-functional math unit (though later versions
of the chip actually removed the math unit). The 80487 SX was a
full 80486 DX with a couple of pins relocated on the package --
to prevent consumers from using the cheaper 80486 DX as an
upgrade option. In this regard, Intel created a marketing
deception. Intel marketed the 80487 SX as a math coprocessor to
the 80486 SX. In reality, the 80487 SX electronically disabled
the 80486 SX when installed, thereby relegating this chip to the
status of an expensive space heater. Sadly, the consumer never
knew or even suspected Intel of playing such manipulative games.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Also like the 80386, the Intel
began to diversify their 80486 offerings. Low-power versions of
the chip were introduced. The 80486 SL was introduced along with
the 80386 SL as an integrated, low-power chip for notebook
applications. The 80486 DX2 and DX4 were introduced, which
doubled and tripled the core clock frequency. Power-saving
features from the SL were introduced in later versions of the
DX4. Finally, after Intel introduced the Pentium chip, they
produced a version of the Pentium that was pin-compatible with
the 80486. They called this chip an &quot;<b><i>overdrive</i></b>&quot;
processor.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Likewise, AMD and Cyrix continued
to pursue their own 486-compatible chip solutions. AMD introduced
many Am486 variants. Cyrix continued their nomenclature of
calling an 80486-compatible chip, the Cyrix 5x86. TI continued to
manufacture Cyrix chips, and eventually started their own
in-house microprocessor design (though the effort eventually
failed). UMC entered the CPU market, but later withdrew because
of patent infringement problems. IBM began manufacturing for
Cyrix, and still pursuing their own microprocessor designs (the
Blue Lightning series).</font></p>

<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial">The 80386</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">In 1985, Intel introduced the
80386. Like the 80286 before it, the 80386 added significant
programming and addressibility enhancements. Protected mode was
enhanced to allow easy transitions between it and real mode
(without resetting the microprocessor). Another new operating
mode (v86 mode) was introduced to allow DOS programs to execute
within a protected mode environment. Addressibility was further
enhanced to 32-bits, giving the 80386 four gigabytes of memory
addressibility (2^32 = 4 GB).</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Also like the 80286, the 80386 was
not introduced in any computer systems for many years after its
introduction. Compaq was the first mainstream company to
introduce an 80386-based computer -- beating IBM to market.
Regardless, the 80386 enjoyed a very long life for home and
business computer users. This long life was largely due to the
programming extensions in the 80386 -- namely the ability to
create a protected mode operating system to take advantage of all
4 GB of potential memory while still being able to run legacy DOS
applications.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Shortly after the 80386 was
introduced, Intel introduced the 80386 SX. To avoid confusion,
Intel renamed the 80386 to the 80386 DX. The SX was a
cost-reduced 80386 with a 16-bit data bus, and 24-bit address
bus. The 16-bit data bus meant the SX was destined to have lower
memory throughput than its DX counterpart; while the 24-bit
address bus mean that the SX could only address 16 MB of physical
memory. Regardless of the address bus and data bus differences,
the SX and DX were software compatible with each other. Intel
also introduced the 80376 as part of the 80386 family. The 376
was an 80386 SX that exclusively ran in protected mode.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">During its long reign, the
80386-based computer began to evolve. Chipset vendors began
dreaming of ways they could help improve the performance of the
computer, thus giving their products a competitive advantage. One
of the innovations was the introduction of the memory </font><a
href="help.htm#Cache"><font size="3" face="Arial">cache</font></a><font
size="3" face="Arial">. The memory cache within the chipset would
play a huge role in Intel's future product plans. First, Intel
introduced a cache . Later, they incorporated the cache into the
microprocessor itself. Intel also made their second failed
attempt at chip integration. The 80386 SL integrated core logic,
chipset functionality, and power-saving features into the
microprocessor.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">During this time, the popularity
of the personal computer, and most notably their Intel
microprocessors, didn't escape the notice of many entrepreneurs
wishing to cash in on Intel's business. AMD began their own
&quot;x86&quot; microprocessor division. IIT began cloning the
Intel math coprocessors. Other small startups, such as Cyrix and
Nexgen, decided they too could design an Intel-compatible
microprocessor. The aspirations of these companies didn't bode
well within Intel. Shortly thereafter, Intel began taking
measures to ensure their own dominance in the industry -- to the
exclusion of everybody else. Hence, Intel began what many believe
are anti-competitive (illegal) business practices.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">In spite of Intel's business
practices, many 80386 clones began to appear. AMD marketed the
Am386 microprocessors in speeds from 16 MHz to 40 MHz, though it
was possible to overclock this chip up to 80 MHz. IBM introduced
the 386 SLC, which featured a low-power 386 with an integrated
8-KB cache. IBM created other 386/486 hybrid chips -- some that
were pin-compatible with Intel, and others that were not. Chips
and Technologies created their own 386 clone. Cyrix stunned
everybody by offering a 386 pin-compatible CPU, but called it a
486 (a nomenclature pattern that Cyrix still uses). Texas
Instruments served as a foundry for Cyrix, and negotiated rights
to produce chips under their own name. Eventually, TI produced
their own chips (based on the Cyrix core), with their own unique
enhancements.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial">The 80286</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">In 1982, Intel introduced the
80286. For the first time, Intel did not simultaneously introduce
an 8-bit bus version of this processor (ala 80288). The 80286
introduced some significant microprocessor extensions. Intel
continued to extend the instruction set; but more significantly,
Intel added four more </font><a href="help.htm#Address Lines"><font
size="3" face="Arial">address lines</font></a><font size="3"
face="Arial"> and a new operating mode called &quot;protected
mode.&quot; Recall that the number of address lines directly
relates to amount of physical that can be addressed by the
microprocessor. The 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188 all contained 20
address lines, giving these processors one megabyte of
addressibility (2^20 = 1MB). The 80286, with its 24 address
lines, gives 16 megabytes of addressibility (2^24 = 16 MB).</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">For the most part, the new
instructions of the 80286 were introduced to support the new
protected mode. Real mode was still limited to the one megabyte
program addressing of the 8086, et al. For all intents and
purposes, a program could not take advantage of the 16-megabyte
address space without using protected mode. Unfortunately,
protected mode could not run real-mode (DOS) programs. These
limitations thwarted attempts to adopt the 80286 programming
extensions for mainstream consumer use.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">IBM was spurred by the huge
success of the IBM PC and decided to use the 80286 in their next
generation computer, the IBM PC-AT. However, the PC-AT was not
introduced until 1985 -- three years after introduction of the
80286. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">During the reign of the 80286, the
first &quot;chipsets&quot; were introduced. The computer chipset
was nothing more than a set of chips that replaced dozens of
other peripheral chips, while maintaining identical
functionality. Chips and Technologies became one of the first
popular chipset companies.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Like the IBM PC, the PC-AT was
hugely successful for home and business use. Intel continued to
second-source the chips to ensure an adequate supply of chips to
the computer industry. Intel, AMD, IBM, and Harris were known to
produce 80286 chips as OEM products; while Siemens, Fujitsu, and
Kruger either cloned it, or were also second-sources. Between
these various manufacturers, the 80286 was offered in speeds
ranging from 6 MHz to 25 MHz.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial">The 80186 / 80188</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Intel continued the evolution of
the 8086 and 8088 by introducing the 80186 and 80188. These
processors featured new instructions, new fault tolerance
protection, and was Intel's first of many failed attempts at the
x86 chip integration game. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The new instructions and fault
tolerance additions were logical evolutions of the 8086 and 8088.
Intel added instructions that made programming much more
convenient for low-level (assembly language) programmers. Intel
also added some fault tolerance protection. The original 8086 and
8088 would hang when they encountered an invalid computer
instruction. The 80186 and 80188 added the ability to trap this
condition and attempt a recovery method.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Intel integrated this processor
with many of the peripheral chips already employed in the IBM-PC.
The 80186 / 80188 integrated interrupt controllers, interval
timers, DMA controllers, clock generators, and other core support
logic. In many ways, this chip was produced a decade ahead of its
time. Unfortunately, this chip didn't catch on with many hardware
manufacturers; thus spelled the end of Intel's first attempt at
CPU integration. However, this chip has enjoyed a tremendous
success in the world of embedded processors. If you look on your
high performance disk driver or disk controller, you might still
see an 80186 being used.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Eventually, many embedded
processor vendors began manufacturing these chips as a second
source to Intel, or in clones of their own. Between the various
vendors, the 80186/80188 was available in speeds ranging from 6
MHz to 40 MHz.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial">The 8086 / 8088</font></h3>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 8086 and 8088 were binary
compatible with each other, but not pin-compatible. Binary
compatibility means that either microprocessor could execute the
same programs. Pin-incompatibility means that you can&#146;t plug
the 8086 into the 8088 and visa versa, and expect the chips to
work. The new &quot;x86&quot; chips implemented a Complex
Instruction Set Computer (</font><a href="help.htm#CISC"><font
size="3" face="Arial">CISC</font></a><font size="3" face="Arial">)
design methodology. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 8086 and 8088 both feature
twenty address pins. The number of address pins determines how
much memory a microprocessor can access. Twenty address pins gave
these microprocessors a total address space of one megabyte (2^20
= one megabyte).</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 8086 and 8088 featured
different data bus sizes. The data bus size determines how many
bytes of data the microprocessor can read in each cycle. The 8086
featured a 16-bit data bus, while the 8088 featured an 8-bit data
bus. IBM chose to implement the 8088 in the IBM-PC, thus saving
some cost and design complexity.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">At the time IBM introduced the
IBM-PC, a fledgling Intel Corporation struggled to supply enough
chips to feed the hungry assembly lines of the expanding personal
computer industry. Therefore to ensure sufficient supply to the
personal computer industry, Intel subcontracted the fabrication
rights of these chips to AMD, Harris, Hitachi, IBM, Siemens, and
possibly others. Amongst Intel and their cohorts, the 8086 line
of processors ran at speeds ranging from 4 MHz to 16 MHz.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">It didn&#146;t take long for the
industry to start &quot;cloning&quot; the IBM-PC. Many companies
tried; but mostly they all failed because their BIOS was not
compatible with the IBM-PC BIOS. Columbia, Kayro and others went
by the wayside because they were not totally PC-compatible.
Compaq broke though the compatibility barrier with the
introduction of the Compaq portable computer. Compaq's success
created the turning point that enabled today's modern computer
industry.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">NEC was the first to
&quot;clone&quot; this new Intel chip with their V20 and V30
designs. The V20 was pin-compatible with the 8088, while the V30
was pin-compatible with the 8086. The V-series ran approximately
20% faster than the Intel chips when running at the same clock
speed. Therefore, the V-series chips provided a cheap
&quot;upgrade&quot; to owners of the IBM-PC and other clones
computers. The V-series chips were very interesting. These chips
were introduced in 1985 at approximately the same time as Intel's
introduction of the 80386. The 80386 was still years away from
production, and the 80286 was just barely being accepted in the
IBM-PC/AT. Even though these chips were pin-compatible with the
8086 and 8088, they also had some extensions to the architecture.
They featured all of the &quot;new&quot; instructions on the
80186 / 80188, and also were capable of running in Z-80 mode
(directly running programs written for the Z-80 microprocessor).</font></p>
