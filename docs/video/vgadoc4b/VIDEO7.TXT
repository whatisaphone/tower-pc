    Two methods exists:

    All models can use method 1:
      For 2 and 4 color modes bit 16 of the address is in 3C2h bit 5.

      For 16 color modes separate read and write banks can be selected
      through 3C4h index F6h.

      For 256 color modes the bank fields in 3C4h index F6h select
      bit 18&19 of the video memory address.
      Bit 16 is selected through 3C4h index F9h bit 0.
      Bit 17 is selected through Miscellaneous Output Register
             (3C2h/3CCh bit 5).
      Bit 16&17 are shared by read and write operations.

    For Version 4 (HT208-A) and above separate bank registers are available.
    Both read and write banks exists.
