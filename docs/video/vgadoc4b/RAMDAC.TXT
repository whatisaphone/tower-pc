15-bit modes have 5 bits of each basic color:
bit  0- 4 blue.
     5- 9 green.
    10-14 red.
The pixel is stored in two bytes in Intel style (little endian).

16-bit modes have 5 bits of red and blue, and 6 bits of green:
bits 0- 4  blue.
     5-10  green.
    11-15  red.
The pixel is stored in two bytes in Intel style (little endian).

24-bit modes have 8 bits of each basic color:
bits 0- 7  blue.
     8-15  green
    16=23  red.
The pixel is stored in three bytes in Intel style (little endian).



The DACs are addressed on port 3C6h-3C9h. Advanced DACs have 1 or 2 extra
address lines (RS2 and RS3). These may be controlled from high address bits
(A10-A15) (Compaq or Weitek cards) or from registers (S3, ATI....).
In the following the DAC registers are named REGxx as follows:

            I/O:     RS2:     RS3:
REG00       3C8h      0        0
REG01       3C9h      0        0
REG02       3C6h      0        0
REG03       3C7h      0        0
REG04       3C8h      1        0
REG05       3C9h      1        0
REG06       3C6h      1        0
REG07       3C7h      1        0
REG08       3C8h      0        1
REG09       3C9h      0        1
REG0A       3C6h      0        1
REG0B       3C7h      0        1
REG0C       3C8h      1        1
REG0D       3C9h      1        1
REG0E       3C6h      1        1
REG0F       3C7h      1        1



Many of these DACs can access REG06 using only the 4 standard DAC addresses
(3C6h-3C9h) by reading 3C6h 4 or 5 times, then REG06 can be accessed at 3C6h.

  Type:

  "1r/w"   Read 3C6h 4 times, then the next read or write of 3C6h will access
           the command register.


Forcing HiColor DACs into command mode:
Note: This works on the Sierra, ATT, Winbond DACs and clones, not on the
 Brooktree or TI DACs, also the MUSIC DACs will require an extra read of 3C6h.

procedure dactocomm;   {switches DAC to command register}
var x:word;
begin
  x:=inp($3C8);    {clear old state}
  x:=inp($3C6);
  x:=inp($3C6);
  x:=inp($3C6);    {Read $3C6 4 times.}
  x:=inp($3C6);
end;

Now reads and writes to $3C6 will access the command register. Depending on
the DAC type you may have multiple read/writes, one write/multiple reads or
one read/write of the command register before it switches back to the PEL
register. Any access to $3C7-$3C9 will switch back to the PEL mask register.


Forcing HiColor DACs into normal mode:

procedure dactopel;  {switches DAC back to normal mode}
var x:word;
begin
  x:=inp($3C8);
end;




HiColor DACs:     (Sierra SC1148x, MUSIC MU9C4870, OAK OTI66HC, UMC UM70C178)

REG04 (R/W):  Overlay RAM Write Address               (SC11481/2/4/5/8/9 only)
bit 0-3  Write index for the Overlay registers.

REG05 (R/W):  Overlay RAM                             (SC11481/2/4/5/8/9 only)
bit 0-5  Data port for the overlay registers. Works like the PEL data register
         (3C9h) except that the overlay registers are accessed and the Overlay
         Address registers are used for indexes.
Note: on the SC11484/8/9 the Color Look-up Table and the overlay registers are
      24bits wide (rather than 18bits) if the 8/6 pin is high.

REG06 (R/W):  Command Register
bit   0  (SC11487) (R) Set if bits 5-7 is 1 or 3, clear otherwise
    3-4  (SC11487) Accesses bits 3-4 of the PEL Mask registers (REG02)
      5  (not SC11481/6/8)
         If set two pixel clocks are used to latch the two bytes
         needed for each pixel. Low byte is latched first.
         If clear the low byte is latched on the rising edge of the
         pixel clock and the high byte is latched on the falling edge.
         Only some VGA chips (ET4000 and C&T655x0) can handle this.
      6  (SC11485/7/9, OTI66HC, UM70C178) Set in 16bit (64k) modes (Only valid
           if bit 7 set). On the SC11482/3/4 this bit is read/writable, but
           has no function. On the SC11481/6/8 this bit does not exist.
      7  Set in HiColor (32k/64k) modes, clear in palette modes.
Note:  This register can also be accessed at 3C6h by reading 3C6h four times,
       then all accesses to 3C6h will go the this register until one of the
       registers 3C7h, 3C8h or 3C9h is accessed.

REG07 (R/W):  Overlay RAM Read Address              (SC11481/2/4/5/8/9 only)
bit 0-3  Read index for the Overlay registers.

       4  Sync on Blue if set
       5  Set for 7.5 IRE, clear for 0.0 IRE pedestal (affects DAC range).
       6  Enables the Overlay registers if set

REG00 index 3 (R/W):  Cursor Register                                    (482)
bit  0-1  Cursor type. 0: disabled, 1: 3-color, 2: Windows, 3: X11 style
       2  Cursor Op disabled if set?
       3  If clear reads/writes to REG04,REG05,REG07 will access the cursor
          palette, if set the cursor pattern data will be accessed instead.

REG00 index 4 W(R/W):  Cursor X                                          (482)
bit 0-11  Cursor X position

REG00 index 6 W(R/W):  Cursor Y                                          (482)
bit 0-11  Cursor Y position
Note: the indexed DAC registers are accessed by setting bit 0 of REG06. Then
      REG00 is the index register and REG02 is the data register.

REG04 (R/W):  Cursor Write Address                                       (482)
bit 0-1?  Selects the palette register which will be written at REG05

REG05 (R/W):  Cursor RAM Data                                            (482)
bit  0-7  Cursor palette data
Note: If REG00 index 3 bit 3 is clear this works like the palette address&data
      registers at REG00,REG01&REG03 except that a separate palette is
      accessed. Each read/write of this register will increment first through
      the red,green,blue sequence and then the Address register (REG04/REG07).
      If REG00 index 3 bit 3 is set REG04/REG07 are the lower 8 bits of the
      index into the 1024 byte palette pattern RAM, which will increment for
      each access to this register.

REG06 (R/W):  Command Register A
bit    0  If set the Bt481/2 indexed DAC registers can be accessed by setting
          REG00 to the index and reading or writing the data at REG02.
     4-7  Mode. 0: Palette, 8: 15bit (Dual edge), 9: 24bit (Dual edge),
            Ah: 15bit (32K), Ch: 16bit (Dual edge), Eh: 16bit (64K),
            Fh: 24bit (16m). The Dual edge modes transfers data on both the
          rising and falling edges of the pixel clock.
Note:  This register can also be accessed at REG02 by reading REG02 four
       times. Then the command register can be read or written at REG02.
       This access will be terminated by any access to REG00, REG01 or REG03
       or after a write to the command register (DAC type 4-Nr1w).

REG04 (R/W):  Cursor/Overscan Write Address
bit 0-7  The PEL data register (0..255) to be written to REG05.
Note: After writing the 3 bytes at REG05 this register will increment, pointing
      to the next data register.

REG05 (R/W):  Cursor/Overscan Data
bit 0-5  Color value
Note:  Each read or write of this register will cycle through first the
       registers for Red, Blue and Green, then increment the appropriate
       address register.
Note: the registers REG04,REG05,REG07 works like the normal REG00,REG01,REG03
      registers, except that a separate set of palette registers (16 overlay
      registers ?) are being accessed.
      Index 00h  Overscan color
            01h  Cursor Color 1 (Background)
            02h  Cursor Color 2 (Foreground)
            03h  Cursor Color 3
Note: if the DAC is in 6bit mode (REG06 bit 1 is 0) the 2 upper bits of the
      cursor colors are ignored.

REG06 (R/W):  Command Reg 0
bit   0  Power Down. If set the DACs and RAM power is turned off, but the RAM
         still retains data, if clear the RAMDAC is operating normally
      1  Set if DAC and palette registers are 8bit DACs, clear if 6bit.
      2  Sync on Red if set

      5  Set for 7.5 IRE pedestal, clear for 0.0 IRE.
      6  Disables internal clocking if set
      7  (485,505) Enable CR3. If clear the Status register is present at
          REG0A, if set 3C8h determines which register is present at REG0A:
            00h    Status Register
            01h    Command Register 3

REG07 (R/W):  Cursor/Overscan Read Address
bit 0-7  The PEL data register (0..255) to be read from REG05.
Note: After reading the 3 bytes at REG05 this register will increment,
      pointing to the next data register.

REG08 (R/W):  Command Reg 1
bit    0  In 15/16bit 1:1 mode selects the pixel port (A-B or C-D) to take
          pixel data from. Clear for A-B, set for C-D. See bit 1.
       1  PORTSEL. In 15bit 1:1 mode (bit 2 set & bit 3 clear), this bit if
          set causes pin P7D (most significant bit of the C-D port) to select
          whether the 15bit pixel data is taken from port A-B or port C-D,
          thus allowing real-time switching between video sources.
       2  SPARSE. Set if 16bit data is 1:1, clear if it is muxed 2:1
       3  Set in 5/6/5 mode, clear in all other modes
       4  If set decodes True-color pixel data (5/5/5, 5/6/5 or 8/8/8 mode),
          directly, if clear each component (R-G-B) of the pixel data is used
          is used as a separate index to the palette RAM for the specific RGB
          component, allowing non-linear scales (gamma correction) for each
          color-component. REG09 bit 2 controls the indexing.
     5-6  Bits per pixel. 0: 24, 1: 15/16, 2: 8, 3: 4

REG09 (R/W):  Command Reg 2
bit  0-1  Cursor mode. 0: Disabled, 1: 3-Color, 2: Windows, 3: X11 Style
       2  Sparse or Contigous Indexing. In Look-up True-color modes (REG08 bit
          4 clear) selects whether each color component is shifted right or
          left before being used as an index to the palette. If set the pixel
          data is treated as the least significant bits of the index
          (Contigous index), if clear as the most significanty bits (Sparse
          index).
       3  Set in interlaced modes (used for the cursor).
       4  Selects input clock. 0: PCLK0, 1: PCLK1
       5  If clear the dac takes data from the VGA port and each byte is a one
          byte palette index regardless of the state in Command Register 1, if
          set pixel data is taken from pixel ports A-D and data format is
          controlled by Command Register 1

bit  0-7  Data port for the Hardware Cursor Map.
          There are either 2 128byte (32x32bit) or 2 512 byte (64x64bit) maps
          depending on REG0A bit 2. The first is the cursor image and the
          second is the cursor shape.
          To update the cursor map, write the start address to REG00and start
          writing to this register. The index will increment for each byte.

Chrontel CH8391 and CH8398:
REG04 (R/W):  Clock RAM Write Address
bit  0-?  Selects the register that is writable at REG05. The first write
          accesses the low byte of the register and the second the high byte.
Note: Reading this register 4 times will cause the next access of this
      register to go to the "Hidden Clock" register.

REG04 (R/W):  Clock Select Register
bit  0-3  Selects the Video Clock.
     4-6  Selects the Memory Clock
       7  Frequency hold. If set the video and memory clock selects in bits
           0-6 are ORed with the actual inputs from the clock select pins
Note: This register is accessed6 by reading REG04 4 timers first.

REG05 (R/W):  Clock RAM Data Register
Note: each indexed register addressed here is 16bit wide and thus must be
      read/written as two bytes, low byte first.

REG05 index 00h-0Fh W(R/W):  Video Clock Select 0-15
bit  0-7  N. Numerator. Effective value (n) is N+8. The following N values
           may give unstable output: 0-7, 10-15, 19-23, 28-31, 37-39, 46-47
           and 55.
    8-13  M. Denominator. Effective value (m) is M+2. It is recommended to
           use N<11 for best clock performance
   14-15  K. Clock Divider. Effective divider (k) is: 0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 8
The resulting clock is: ref*n/(m*k) where ref is the reference clock, usually
 14.31818MHz and n,m and k are the effective (as opposed to coded) factors
Note: The CH8398 apparently has Video Clock 0 hardcoded as 25.175MHz and
      Video Clock 1 hardcoded as 28.322. The CH8391 does not.

REG05 index 10h-17h W(R/W):  Memory Clock Select 0-7
Probably same coding as the Video Clocks.

REG06 (R/W):  Control Register (CH8391)
bit    0  Power Down if set
       1  If set the DAC and palette registers are 8bit wide (256 colors of
           16Mcolors), if clear 6bit (256 colors of 256K colors)
     5-7  Color mode. 0: Palette, 5: 15bit, 6: 16bit, 7: 24bit
Note: This register can also be accessed by reading 3C6h 4 times in a row.
      The 4th read will return the chip ID (B3h for the CH8391) and the 5th
      read or write will access this register ("1r/w" type Cmd register).

REG06 (R/W):  Control Register (CH8398)
bit    0  Power Down if set
       2  Always set ??
     4-7  Color mode. 0: Palette, 1: 15bit, 3: 16bit, 5: 24bit, 6: 16bit,
           7: 24bit, 11: 24bit, 12: 15bit
Note: This register can also be accessed by reading 3C6h 4 times in a row.
      The 4th read will return the chip ID (C0h for the CH8398) and the 5th
      read or write will access this register ("1r/w" type Cmd register).

REG07 (R/W):  Clock RAM Read Address
bit  0-?  Selects the register that is readable at REG05. The first read
          accesses the low byte of the register and the second the high byte.

 - How close is this to the Cirrus Logic CL-GD5200 & Acumos ADAC1 ?
REG02 (R/W):  Hidden DAC Register
bit  0-3  Extended Mode Select. If bit 6 and 7 are both set this field
          selects the DAC mode:
              0:  5-5-5 15bit Sierra HiColor
              1:  5-6-5 16bit "XGA" HiColor
              5:  (5422+) 8-8-8 24bit TrueColor. This mode also exists on the
                    5420 rev1, but is not documented.
            6/7:  (5428+) DAC Power-down
              8:  (5428+) 8bit Greyscale.
              9:  (5428+) 3-3-2 8bit RGB
       4  32K Color Control. If set bit 15 (MSB) of a 15bit pixel selects
          whether the pixel is HiColor(bit 15 = 0) or palette data(bit 15 = 1,
          bit 0-7 is the palette index). This bit only has effect in 5-5-5
          15bit modes.
       5  Clocking Mode. If set Clocking Mode 2 will be selected and data will
          only be latched on the rising edge of DCLK, if clear Clocking Mode 1
          will be selected and data will be latched on both the rising edge
          (low byte) and falling edge (high byte) of DCLK. This bit only has
          effect in 15/16 bit modes as all other modes will use Clocking Mode
          2. Clocking Mode 1 should only be used for externally supplied DCLK
          and pixel data.
       6  Enable ALL Extended Modes. If bit 7 is set and this bit is clear the
          DAC is in 5-5-5 15bit Sierra HiColor mode, if both bit 7 and this
          bit are set bits 0-3 determines the DAC mode.
       7  Enable 5-5-5 Mode. If set the DAC is in an advanced mode, depending
          on the other bits in this register, if clear the DAC is in VGA
          compatible palette mode.
Note: This register is accessed by reading REG02 four times to unlock this
      register, then the next read or write of REG02 will access this register.
      After reading or writing this register the register is locked and this
      register can only be accessed be redoing the 4 reads of REG02 etc. Any
      access to REG00,REG01,REG03 will also lock this register. The 5428 is the
      exception where reads of this register will NOT lock it.
Note: When REG02 is 0FFh the access to this register described above does
x      not always work.
Note: This register does not exist on the 5401/5402 and the 5420 rev A.

REG05 (R/W):  PLL Parameters
The PLL registers accessed at this register are indexed via REG04 (writes) and
REG07 (reads). As all but index 0Eh are two byte registers which are accessed
via two reads or writes (low byte first) each of the indexes have an internal
flip-flop to track low/high byte. Each read of REG05 will increment the read
index (with the flip-flop incremented first). Writes increment the write
index (REG04) similarly.

bit  0-6  M. Numerator.
    8-11  N1. Quotient. Prescales REF for the PLL.
   12-13  N2. Clock divider. Divides the output clock by: 0: /1, 1: /2,
            2: /4, 3: /8
   14-15  PLL Mode Select. 0: Normal PLL mode - the output frequency is
          calculated as: f=REF*(M+1)/((N1+1)*(2^N2)), 1: High-resolution
          Low-frequency mode - same as PLL mode, but the output clock is
          divided by 1024, 2: OFF - The output is set HIGH, 3: Low-resolution
          Low-frequency mode - Output clock is: f=REF/((M+1)*(2^N2))
REF is the reference clock, typically 14.31818MHz. For best results the
following constraints should be observed: REF should be in the 5MHz - 32Mhz
range. REF/(N1+1) should be in the 2MHz - 16MHz range (for REF=14.31818MHz
 N1 should be in the range 1-6) and REF*(M+1)/(N1+1) should be in the 40MHz
 to 80MHz range.

SGS-Thompson STG1700/2/3 Truecolor DACs:
All the STG DACs have 16bit pixel data path, but the 1700 can not use the
packed 24bit mode where 2 pixels are transferred in 3 pixel clocks.
The 1703 has built-in clock generator.

REG04 (R/W):  Index Low
bit  0-7  Index for the register accessible via REG05. The high byte (always
           0) is in REG07.

REG05 (R/W):  Indexed Register
There are a series of indexed registers in the STG DACs. If REG06 bit 4 is set
they are accessed by the two index bytes to REG02 and then reading or writing
the indexed registers at REG02 (index will autoincrement). If REG06 bit 4 is
clear the index is written to REG04 & REG07 and the indexed register are read
or written at REG05.

TI TLC34058, Brooktree Bt458 DACs
These DACs are intended for high bandwidth systems and are not VGA compatible.
They use 4 or 5 separate pixel ports in parallel for higher bandwidth

REG04 (R/W)  Index Register.
bit  0-7  Index for accesses through 3C6h, 3C7h and 3C9h. For 3C7h and 3C9h
          there is also an internal counter for the (Red, Green and Blue)
          cycle. This counter is reset when this register is written.
          Each access to 3C7h or 3C9h will increment first the RGB counter and
          then this register.

REG05 (R/W)  Palette Data
bit  0-7  Palette data port. 3C8h selects the entry in the palette RAM. Each
          read or write of this register increments index, first through the
          Red, Green & Blue and then increments register 3C8h

REG06 (R/W)  Control Data.
bit  0-7  Data port for the Control registers. 3C8h is the index. Unlike 3C7h

          palette RAM. This is similar to 3C6h in standard VGA systems.

REG06 index 5 (R/W):  Blink Mask Register
bit  0-7  In the blink off period the pixel data is ANDed with the inverse of
          this register, Ie. the '0' bits in this register will protect the
          corresponding bits of the pixel data from blinking, while '1' bits
          will force the corresponding pixel data bits low during the blink
          off period.

REG06 index 6 (R/W):  Command Register

       1  OL1 Display Enable. If clear the overlay pin 1 (OL1) is forced to 0
       2  OL0 Blink Enable. If set (and bit 0 set) the overlay pin 0 toggles
          between 0 and the actual value at the blink rate
       3  OL1 Blink Enable. If set (and bit 1 set) the overlay pin 1 toggles
          between 0 and the actual value at the blink rate
     4-5  Blink Rate Select. Selects the blink rate in vertical periods:
            0: 16on/48off, 1: 16on/16off, 2: 32on/32off, 3: 64on/64off
       6  RAM Enable. If the overlay select pins (OL0-1) are 0 this bit
          selects the output. Set for palette RAM data, clear for overlay
          register 0.
       7  Multiplex Select. Set for 5:1 multiplexing, clear for 4:1
          multiplexing - pixel port E is ignored and should be tied low

REG06 index 7 (R/W):  Test Register
bit  0-3  Selects the data to be returned in bit 4-7 when reading this
          register. Selects upper or lower 4 bits of one of the 3 DAC inputs:
              1: return 4MSB of Red         9: return 4LSB of Red
              2: return 4MSB of Green      10: return 4LSB of Green
              4: return 4MSB of Blue       12: return 4LSB of Blue
     4-7  (R) Data selected by bits 0-3

REG07 (R/W)  Overlay Data
bit  0-7  Overlay data port. 3C8h selects the entry in the overlay RAM (0-3).

UMC UM70c178 Hi-Color DACs:

REG06 (R/W):  Command Register
bit 0-4  (R) Always 0
    5-7  Mode: 5: 15bit, 7: 16bit.
Note:  This register can also be accessed at REG02 by reading REG02 four
       times. Then the command register can be read or written at REG02.
       This access will be terminated by any access to REG00, REG01 or REG03
       or after write of the command register.  (DAC type 4-Nr1w).




UMC UM70c188 TrueColor DACs:

REG06 (R/W):  Command Register
bit 0-3  (R) Always 0
      4  Set in 24bit mode, clear in all other modes
    5-7  Mode: 5: 15bit, 7: 16bit. Don't care for 24bit
Note:  This register can also be accessed at REG02 by reading REG02 four
       times. Then the command register can be read or written at REG02.
       This access will be terminated by any access to REG00, REG01 or REG03
       or after a read or write of the command register.  (DAC type 4-1r1w).





Forcing HiColor DACs into command mode:
Note: This works on the Sierra, ATT, Winbond DACs and clones, not on the
 Brooktree or TI DACs, also the MUSIC DACs will require an extra read of 3C6h.

procedure dactocomm;   {switches DAC to command register}
var x:word;
begin
  x:=inp($3C8);    {clear old state}
  x:=inp($3C6);
  x:=inp($3C6);
  x:=inp($3C6);    {Read $3C6 4 times.}
  x:=inp($3C6);
end;

Now reads and writes to $3C6 will access the command register. Depending on
the DAC type you may have multiple read/writes, one write/multiple reads or
one read/write of the command register before it switches back to the PEL
register. Any access to $3C7-$3C9 will switch back to the PEL mask register.
