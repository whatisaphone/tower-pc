TKD8001 "ColorSync" truecolor RAMDAC


   What are the specs for all the new chips??  (CX,CXi,CL,CXr,GUI...)
   The Trident 8800 chips have a problem with 256 color modes,
   as they always double the pixels output in 256 color mode.
   Thus a 640x400 256 color mode (5Ch) actually uses a 1280x400
   frame, requiring at least a multi sync monitor.
   This problem is fixed on the 8900.

Apparently Trident BIOS version 3.xx or later on a 8900C will support Sierra
HiColor DACs (SC11483 or SC11487). No check is made for the existence of such
a DAC, the mode is just set as if it was present, resulting in 1024x480,
1280x480 and 1600x600 256color modes if an ordinary DAC is installed.

       The 63h, 73h, 83h, A3h and F3h entries are still in doubt.

Note:  Writing to index Bh selects old mode registers.
       Reading from index Bh selects new mode registers.
Note:  Writing to this register in order to force old mode registers
       should be done with two 8bit writes, not one 16bit write.

3C4h index 0Ch (R/W): Power Up Mode Register 1
bit   0  Fast Decode if set, Slow if clear
      1  (9000 & LCD9100) If clear 0 Wait states,
              if set bit 6 determines number of wait states.
      4  If set enable post port at 3C3h, at 46E8h if clear
      5  (8900C)  If set enables access to upper 512KB in non-paged modes
                  Must be clear in text and CGA modes.
         (9000 & LCD9100) If set uses 2 DRAMs, 4 if clear
      6  (9000 & LCD9100) If bit 1 is clear this bit determines the number
              of wait states. If set 2 Wait states, 1 if clear.
    5-6  (88xx and 89xx) 0=256K chip, 1 = 2 DRAMs, 2 = 4 DRAMs, 3 = 8 DRAMs.
      7  If set VRAM bus setting is 16, 8 if clear
Note: This register can only be changed if New Mode Control 1 (3C4h index 0Eh)
      bit 7 is set

3C4h index 0Dh (R/W): Old Mode Control 2
bit 0-2  Emulation mode
         0=VGA, 3=EGA, 5=CGA,MDA,Hercules
      4  Enable Paging mode if set. If set the CRTC offset (3d4h index 13h)
         should be multiplied by 2, and the Display Start Address (3d4h index
         0Ch & 0Dh + 1Eh bit 5 and 3C4h Old Mode index 0Eh bit 0) is in units
         of 8 bytes rather than 4 (256 color modes only).
      5  DRAM clock enabled if set.

3C4h index 0Dh (R/W): New Mode Control 2                          (not 8800BR)
bit   0  Clock Select bit 2. Bits 0-1 are in 3CCh bits 2-3.

         For the 8800 and 8900B only the first 8 clocks are available.
         For the 9000i line 3 is: 8: 25.175, 9: 28.322, 10: 62.3, 11: 44.9
    1-2  Divide pixel clock by: 0=1, 1=2, 2=4, 3=1.5
      6  (9xxx) Clock Select bit 3. See bit 0
Note: The old/new Mode Control 1/2 registers are selected by
      reading and writing the Chip version register (index Bh).

3C4h index 0Eh (R/W): Old Mode Control 1
bit   0  (8900 Only) CRTC Address bit 17. Apparently this determines in which
         part of memory the display is, as the display can not cross this
         line, but can be on either side. Note that in Paged Mode (3C4h Old
         Mode index 0Dh bit 4 is set) this bit has no effect as 17 bits can
         span the entire 1MB range.
    1-2  128kb Bank number (0-3)
      3  16 bit video interface if set
      4  (8900C, CL, CXr, GUI9420) Clock Select bit 3.
         See New mode 3C4h index Dh bit 0.

3C4h index 0Eh (R/W): New Mode Control 1                          (not 8800BR)
bit 0-3  64k Bank nbr. When writing to this field XOR with 02h, when reading
         from this field no XOR is needed. This is used for Trident detection.
         In planar modes bits 0 and 2 form a two bit field.
    4-6  Reserved
      7  Must be set to update index 0Ch ???
Note: The old/new Mode Control 1/2 registers are selected by
      reading and writing the Chip version register (index Bh).

3C4h index  Fh (R/W): Power-up Mode 2
bit 0-3  Switch settings
      4  Bus type
      5  If set I/O address are at 3xxh, else at 2xxh.
      6  Enable ON-Card ROM if set
      7  16 bit ROM access enabled if set

3CEh index 0Eh (R/W):  New Source Address Register           (8900CL/D,9200 +)
bit 0-3  Bank register. If 3CEh index Fh bit 2 is clear and bit 0 is set this
         is the read bank and 3C4h index Eh the write register. Note that bit
          1 is inverted like 3C4h index Eh bit 1.

3CEh index 0Fh (R/W):  Miscellaneous Extended Functions      (8900CL/D,9200 +)
bit   0  DUAL. If set selects dual bank mode with separate read and write
         bank registers. If bit 2 is set 3D9h is the read bank and 3D8h the
         write bank, if bit 2 is clear 3CEh index Eh is the read bank and 3C4h
         index Eh the write bank
         3D8h is the combined read/write bank. Only active if bit 2 is set.
      1  When set the packed pixel modes (256 or more colors) uses bits 0-1 of
         the PEL panning register (3C0h index 13h) for single pixel horizontal
         scrolling rather than bits 1-2 (as Standard VGA).
      2  ENALTP. Set to use the alternative banking registers at 3D8h/3D9h,
         clear to use the old banking registers.
         ?? Must be set when 3C4h index Ch bit 5 is set ??
      3  If set character clocks are 16pixels wide rather than 8

3d4h index 1Eh (R/W): Module Testing Register
bit  2  Vertical interlace if set
        In interlaced modes the CRTC offset (3d4h index 13h) is the number of
        bytes in TWO scanlines (NOT true for the 9440AGi!).
        Note that in interlaced modes the line doubling caused by index 9 bits
         0-4,7 is unlikely to work, as the (even,odd) linepair is repeated
        rather than each individual line causing stripes.
     3  If set Load fonts from Bottom, from top if clear
     4  If set the display wraps back to line 0 when the line counter reaches
        512.
     5  CRTC Display Start Address bit 16. Bits 0-15 are in 3d4h index Ch,Dh
     7  (not 88xx) Host address bit 16. If clear bit 5 has no effect.
          This does not affect 3C4h Old Mode index 0Eh bit 0.

3d4h index 1Fh (R/W): Software Programming Register
bit 0-1  (8800, 8900, 9000) Memory size  0=256k, 1=512k, 2=768k, 3=1M.
    0-2  (8900CL, 9200CXr, 94xx, 9660) Memory size  0=256k, 1=512k,

        The hardware cursor map appears to be a 32x32x2 or 64x64x2 bitmap
        organised in lines of 8 or 16 bytes, each having first 4 bytes
        (32pixels) of AND data and then 4bytes XOR data (windows style).

bit 0-4  Bank number in 64k units. If 3CEh index Fh bit 0 is set this is the
         write bank, if not the combined read/write bank.
         This register is only active if 3CEh index Fh bit 2 is set.

Note: Ferraro (in Programmer's Guide to... 3rd edition) documents the
      accelerator registers at 21xAh for the later Tridents, however so far
      I have been unable to verify this.

  Everex Viewpoint use Everex modes.


Note: The TVGA9000i has an on-chip DAC with 32k/64k capability.
      The BIOS on the card I have (BIOS version D3.51) doesn't
      seem to handle the Hi/True color modes correctly.
      I have managed to get the 320x200 32k/64k modes working by programming
      the DAC command register directly, but the 512x480 modes and the 320x200
      16m mode still doesn't work
