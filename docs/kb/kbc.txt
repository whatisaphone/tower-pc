8042 Status Register (port 64h read)

       |7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|  8042 Status Register
        | | | | | | | +---- output register (60h) has data for system
        | | | | | | +----- input register (60h/64h) has data for 8042
        | | | | | +------ system flag (set to 0 after power on reset)
        | | | | +------- data in input register is command (1) or data (0)
        | | | +-------- 1=keyboard enabled, 0=keyboard disabled (via switch)
        | | +--------- 1=transmit timeout (data transmit not complete)
        | +---------- 1=receive timeout (data transmit not complete)
        +----------- 1=even parity rec'd, 0=odd parity rec'd (should be odd)

     Port Mode                 Description

       64h  read   8042 status register. Can be read at any time.  See
                   table above for more information.
       64h  write  8042 command register.  Writing this port sets Bit 3
                   of the status register to 1 and the byte is treated
                   as a controller command.  Devices attached to the
                   8042 should be disabled before issuing commands that
                   return data since data in the output register will
                   be overwritten.
       60h  read   8042 output register (should only be read if Bit 0 of
                   status port is set to 1)
       60h  write  8042 data register.  Data should only be written if
                   Bit 1 of the status register is zero (register is empty).
                   When this port is written Bit 3 of the status register
                   is set to zero and the byte is treated as a data.  The
                   8042 uses this byte if it's expecting data for a previous
                   command, otherwise the data is written directly to the
                   keyboard.   See KEYBOARD COMMANDS for information on
                   programming the actual keyboard hardware.

        Fx   Pulse Output Port: Bits 0-3 of the 8042 output port can be
             pulsed low for 6 .s;  Bits 0-3 of command indicate which
             Bits should be pulsed; 0=pulse, 1=don't pulse; pulsing
             Bit 0 results in CPU reset since it is connected to system
             reset line.

       - PC systems previous to the AT use the 8255 PPI as a keyboard
         controller and use the keyboard's internal 8048.
       - the keyboard's internal controller buffers up to 16 bytes of
         make/break code information.  This is common among all PC systems
         and shouldn't be confused with the (32 byte) keyboard buffer
         maintained by the BIOS.
